Password Generator

This password generator takes in user parameters to generate a password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, number, and special characters. The user can select what parameters they would like to have included in their password, as well as how many characters (between 8 and 128) they would like it to be. The result is displayed in the window. I have also included a CLEAR button that clears the window after a password is generated, although it is not required for the generator to work or make a second password.
